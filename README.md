A tiny browser extension to search for selected text in your [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) collection using keyboard shortcuts.

The extension depends on the [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on to work.

Select some text, press the configured shortcut (the default is `Ctrl+Shift+L`), and the extension should open an Anki browser window and query the text.

## TODO

- [ ] better icon
- [ ] provide builds for Chrome and Firefox
